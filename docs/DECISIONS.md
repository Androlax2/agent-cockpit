# Engineering decisions

## 2026-10-28 — Reuse Make as the verification entry point

Cockpit already owns build/test resource controls in Make and its helper scripts.
Local checks and future CI will share those recipes rather than introducing an `xtask`
crate solely to wrap commands. OpenKeychron demonstrates the smaller Make-based approach.

## 2026-10-28 — Extract responsibilities without relocating the workspace

Keep `apps/Cargo.toml` and `apps/target/release`. Installed wrappers and integration
tests depend on that layout. New libraries may live under `apps/crates/`; binary owners
stay in their existing packages initially. A root-level `crates/` move has no demonstrated
benefit worth its operational churn.

## 2026-10-28 — Start from the current applied source

The initial parallel clone inherited broker work later reverted on main. Theo approved
a fresh `refactor/5779dac9-engineering` branch at verified `origin/main` (`652d6e2`),
preserving the old branch and uncommitted work. Only reviewed audit/planning documents
carry forward; reverted broker changes are not part of engineering alignment.
